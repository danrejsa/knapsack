# knapsack

## Context
* Given a knapsack with a certain weight capacity, fill it with loot from a list of items
to achieve the highest value possible.

## Task
* The function takes two parameters: an int specifying the maximum weight the
knapsack can hold, and an array of item objects to choose from. Each item object
has a name, a weight, and a value. The total weight of all the chosen items cannot
exceed the capacity of the knapsack.
* The function should return an object containing the capacity of the bag, a list of
items that were added to the bag (in the same order that they were given), the
total weight of those items, and the total value of the items.
